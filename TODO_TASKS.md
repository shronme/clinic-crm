# TODO Tasks - Clinic CRM

This document lists all the TODO tasks found in the codebase that still need implementation.

## üîê Authentication & Authorization System

### High Priority

#### 1. JWT Authentication Implementation
- **File**: `app/api/deps/auth.py:18`
- **Task**: Replace placeholder authentication with proper JWT token verification
- **Current State**: Uses simple header-based approach for development with mock fallback
- **Required**: Implement JWT token validation and staff information extraction

#### 2. Staff Authentication Context
- **File**: `app/api/v1/endpoints/appointments.py:213`
- **Task**: Extract current staff ID from authentication context
- **Current State**: Staff ID is hardcoded as `None`
- **Required**: Get staff ID from JWT token or session

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- ~~**Business Owner Permissions**~~ - Implemented via business context validation
- ~~**Business Staff Permissions**~~ - Implemented via business context dependency

### Scheduling & Conflict Detection  
- ~~**Async Conflict Checking**~~ - Complete database query implementation
- ~~**Appointment Conflict Detection**~~ - Proper overlap detection with status filtering

### Service Features
- ~~**Service Addons Implementation**~~ - Full addon selection, pricing, duration calculation, and storage

## üìã Implementation Notes

### Remaining Authentication Dependencies
The remaining authentication TODOs are interconnected:

1. **JWT Authentication** (`auth.py:18`) - Foundation for proper authentication
2. **Staff Context** (`appointments.py:213`) - Depends on JWT auth implementation

### Recently Completed Systems ‚úÖ
- **Business Context System** - Multi-tenant business validation with proper error handling
- **Scheduling Conflict Detection** - Complete real-time conflict checking with database queries  
- **Service Addons System** - Full addon selection, pricing, duration calculation, and appointment storage
