# Scheduling Engine Implementation

This document describes the core scheduling engine implementation for the Barber & Beautician CRM system.

## Overview

The scheduling engine provides comprehensive availability calculation and appointment validation, considering all relevant business constraints including:

- Business working hours and breaks
- Staff working hours and breaks  
- Existing appointments and conflicts
- Time off periods and approvals
- Availability overrides (temporary schedule changes)
- Service duration and buffer times
- Lead time policies (minimum advance booking)
- Maximum advance booking policies
- Service addon duration calculations

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **SchedulingEngineService** (`app/services/scheduling.py`)
   - Main service class containing all scheduling logic
   - Handles availability calculations and conflict detection
   - Provides appointment validation and alternative slot suggestions

2. **Scheduling Schemas** (`app/schemas/scheduling.py`)
   - Pydantic models for request/response data
   - Type-safe API contracts
   - Input validation and serialization

3. **API Endpoints** (`app/api/v1/endpoints/scheduling.py`)
   - REST API endpoints for scheduling operations
   - Comprehensive documentation and error handling
   - Support for bulk operations and advanced queries

4. **Database Models**
   - Enhanced existing models with scheduling-specific methods
   - Support for polymorphic relationships (business/staff working hours)
   - Proper indexing for performance

### Key Features

#### Staff Availability Calculation

```python
query = StaffAvailabilityQuery(
    staff_uuid="staff-uuid-1",
    start_datetime=datetime(2024, 1, 15, 9, 0),
    end_datetime=datetime(2024, 1, 15, 17, 0),
    service_uuid="service-uuid-1",  # Optional
    slot_duration_minutes=30,
    include_busy_slots=False
)

slots = scheduling_service.get_staff_availability(query)
```

#### Appointment Validation

```python
request = AppointmentValidationRequest(
    staff_uuid="staff-uuid-1",
    service_uuid="service-uuid-1", 
    requested_datetime=datetime(2024, 1, 15, 10, 0),
    addon_uuids=[]
)

response = scheduling_service.validate_appointment(request)
if not response.is_valid:
    print(f"Conflicts: {[c.message for c in response.conflicts]}")
    print(f"Alternatives: {len(response.alternative_slots)} available")
```

## API Endpoints

### Staff Availability

**GET** `/api/v1/scheduling/staff/availability`

Get available time slots for a staff member.

**Parameters:**
- `staff_uuid` (required): Staff member UUID
- `start_datetime` (required): Start of time range
- `end_datetime` (required): End of time range
- `service_uuid` (optional): Service UUID for compatibility check
- `slot_duration_minutes` (optional): Slot duration (default: 15)
- `include_busy_slots` (optional): Include unavailable slots (default: false)

### Appointment Validation

**POST** `/api/v1/scheduling/appointments/validate`

Validate if an appointment can be scheduled.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "staff_uuid": "staff-uuid-1",
  "service_uuid": "service-uuid-1",
  "requested_datetime": "2024-01-15T10:00:00",
  "customer_uuid": "customer-uuid-1",
  "addon_uuids": []
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "is_valid": true,
  "conflicts": [],
  "alternative_slots": [],
  "total_duration_minutes": 40,
  "estimated_end_time": "2024-01-15T10:40:00"
}
```

### Business Hours

**GET** `/api/v1/scheduling/business/hours`

Get business operating hours for a specific date.

### Staff Schedule

**GET** `/api/v1/scheduling/staff/schedule`

Get comprehensive schedule information for a staff member.

### Advanced Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/v1/scheduling/staff/{staff_uuid}/conflicts` - Check for scheduling conflicts
- **GET** `/api/v1/scheduling/availability/bulk` - Bulk availability for multiple staff
- **GET** `/api/v1/scheduling/next-available` - Find next available appointment slot
- **POST** `/api/v1/scheduling/availability/reserve` - Temporarily reserve a time slot

## Conflict Detection

The scheduling engine detects various types of conflicts:

### Conflict Types

1. **EXISTING_APPOINTMENT** - Time overlaps with existing appointment
2. **TIME_OFF** - Staff has approved time off
3. **OUTSIDE_WORKING_HOURS** - Outside business or staff working hours
4. **INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER** - Not enough buffer time before/after service
5. **LEAD_TIME_VIOLATION** - Doesn't meet minimum advance booking requirement
6. **ADVANCE_BOOKING_VIOLATION** - Exceeds maximum advance booking limit
7. **AVAILABILITY_OVERRIDE** - Conflicts with availability override
8. **STAFF_UNAVAILABLE** - Staff not found or inactive

### Validation Logic

The engine performs validation in this order:

1. **Basic Validation**
   - Staff and service existence
   - Staff is active and bookable

2. **Time Constraints**
   - Business hours compliance
   - Staff working hours compliance
   - Break time avoidance

3. **Conflict Checks**
   - Existing appointment overlaps
   - Time off periods
   - Availability overrides

4. **Policy Validation**
   - Lead time requirements
   - Advance booking limits
   - Service-specific policies

## Working Hours System

The system supports flexible working hours with:

### Polymorphic Design

Working hours can be assigned to:
- **Business** - Default operating hours
- **Staff** - Individual staff schedules

### Features

- **Weekly Schedules** - Different hours for each day of week
- **Break Support** - Configurable break periods
- **Temporary Overrides** - Date range specific changes
- **Inheritance** - Staff hours can override business hours

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Working hours with polymorphic owner
CREATE TABLE working_hours (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    uuid UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    owner_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,  -- 'business' or 'staff'
    owner_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    weekday INTEGER NOT NULL,     -- 0=Monday, 6=Sunday
    start_time TIME NOT NULL,
    end_time TIME NOT NULL,
    break_start_time TIME,
    break_end_time TIME,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    effective_from TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    effective_until TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Availability Check

```python
from app.services.scheduling import SchedulingEngineService
from app.schemas.scheduling import StaffAvailabilityQuery
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize service
scheduling_service = SchedulingEngineService(db_session)

# Check availability
query = StaffAvailabilityQuery(
    staff_uuid="staff-uuid-1",
    start_datetime=datetime(2024, 1, 15, 9, 0),
    end_datetime=datetime(2024, 1, 15, 17, 0),
    slot_duration_minutes=30
)

slots = scheduling_service.get_staff_availability(query)
available_slots = [s for s in slots if s.status == AvailabilityStatus.AVAILABLE]
```

### Appointment Validation

```python
from app.schemas.scheduling import AppointmentValidationRequest

request = AppointmentValidationRequest(
    staff_uuid="staff-uuid-1",
    service_uuid="service-uuid-1",
    requested_datetime=datetime(2024, 1, 15, 10, 0)
)

response = scheduling_service.validate_appointment(request)

if response.is_valid:
    print("‚úÖ Appointment can be scheduled")
else:
    print("‚ùå Conflicts found:")
    for conflict in response.conflicts:
        print(f"  - {conflict.message}")
    
    print(f"üìÖ {len(response.alternative_slots)} alternatives available")
```

### Finding Next Available Slot

```python
# Use API endpoint
import requests

response = requests.get('/api/v1/scheduling/next-available', params={
    'staff_uuid': 'staff-uuid-1',
    'service_uuid': 'service-uuid-1',
    'max_days_ahead': 7
})

data = response.json()
if data['found']:
    slot = data['next_available_slot']
    print(f"Next available: {slot['start_datetime']}")
