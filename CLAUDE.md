This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Barber & Beautician CRM + Booking platform - a lightweight, multi-tenant CRM and online booking system for small barber shops and beauty salons. The project is currently in early development/planning stages.

### Key Features (Planned)
- Multi-business, multi-location support
- Staff and service management with per-staff service mapping
- Real-time appointment scheduling with conflict prevention
- Customer profiles and appointment history
- Post-appointment notes with photos and chemical formulas
- Automated notifications via email/SMS
- Admin web app and customer booking portal (PWA)

### Primary Users
- **Owner/Manager**: Business setup, staff management, analytics
- **Staff/Stylist/Barber**: Availability management, calendar, client notes
- **Front Desk**: Appointment booking and walk-in management
- **Customer**: Service browsing, staff selection, appointment booking

## Project Status

The repository currently contains only the product specification document (`barber_beautician_crm_spec.md`). No code implementation has begun yet.

## Development Setup

**Note**: Development environment and build commands are not yet established as the project is in specification phase.

When development begins, typical commands for this type of application would likely include:
- Development server startup
- Database migrations
- Test execution
- Linting and formatting

## Architecture Notes

Based on the specification, the planned architecture includes:
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture
- Real-time scheduling system with conflict prevention
- Notification system supporting email and SMS/WhatsApp
- Customer-facing booking portal (PWA)
- Admin dashboard for business management
- Integration capabilities for calendar export and potential payment processing

## Key Business Logic

- **Service Management**: Different services have varying durations, prices, and buffer times
- **Staff Scheduling**: Complex availability management with working hours, breaks, and time-off
- **Conflict Prevention**: Real-time appointment validation to prevent double-booking
- **Multi-tenancy**: Each business operates independently with their own data and settings
- **Customer Journey**: Self-service booking to reduce administrative overhead by â‰¥70%

## Development Priorities

When implementation begins, focus areas should include:
1. Multi-tenant data architecture design
2. Real-time scheduling engine with conflict detection
3. Staff availability and service mapping system
4. Customer booking flow optimization
5. Notification system integration
