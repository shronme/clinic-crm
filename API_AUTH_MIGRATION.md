# API Authentication Migration Plan

This document tracks the migration of all API endpoints from header-based authentication to Descope JWT authentication.

## 🎯 **Migration Overview**

**Goal**: Replace all `get_business_from_header` dependencies with `get_current_staff` authentication, extracting business context from the authenticated user.

**Authentication Flow**:
- **Before**: Frontend sends `X-Business-ID` and `X-Staff-ID` headers
- **After**: Frontend sends `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>` with Descope JWT containing user claims

- **Business Context**: Derived from authenticated staff instead of headers
- **Test Status**: 25+ tests passing with new authentication

**✅ All Endpoints Migrated:**
```

---

## 📝 **Implementation Notes**

### **Standard Migration Pattern:**

**Before:**
```python
@router.get("/endpoint")
async def endpoint(
    business_context: BusinessContext = Depends(get_business_from_header),
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
):
```

**After:**
```python
@router.get("/endpoint") 
async def endpoint(
    current_staff: Staff = Depends(get_current_staff),
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
):
    # Business context available via current_staff.business_id
    # No need for separate business_context dependency
```

### **Role-Based Access Control:**
For Business API endpoints, add role validation:
```python
if current_staff.role != "OWNER_ADMIN":
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Owner admin access required")
```

### **Business Context Validation:**
Replace business_context checks with:
```python
if entity.business_id != current_staff.business_id:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Resource not found")
```
